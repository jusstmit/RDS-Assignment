# QUESTION :-
# Construct a three-dimensional array with four layers, each a 3 x 3 matrix filled with random numbers between 1 and 9. 
# Then, extract the elements of the first row of the third column across all layers and store them as a new vector. 


# Construct the 3D array with four layers, each a 3 x 3 matrix filled with random numbers between 1 and 9
array_3d <- array(sample(1:9, 3 * 3 * 4, replace = TRUE), dim = c(3, 3, 4))
print(array_3d)
# Output :-
# , , 1

#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1    3    7
